This gives the UI a coherent feel, with whatever syntax theme you like to use.\n\n![Atom Dark Fusion](http://i.imgur.com/u8btyfR.png)\n\n#### Installation\nInside atom go to settings, select Install and search for Nucleus.\n\nOr install directly from the console:\n\n`apm install nucleus-dark-ui`\n\n#### Requirements\nEvery color used in the UI is taken directly from a (dark) syntax theme. In order for this to work, the syntax theme needs to have a `syntax-variables.less`. A light version of this theme is still being worked on.\n\n#### Support\n[Buy me a coffee to keep me going](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=YW2GB7ABTVCVA)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ignism/nucleus-dark-ui/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/ignism/nucleus-dark-ui#readme","_id":"nucleus-dark-ui@0.10.2","_shasum":"03e534966a4c5118cd024fa13d8b809ae5bb7cc9","_resolved":"file:../d-116826-31247-1kw0yg0/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116826-31247-1kw0yg0/package.tgz"}
