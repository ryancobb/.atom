# Nucleus Dark UI

Nucleus is an adaptable UI theme for Atom with your favorite syntax coloring at its core! This gives the UI a coherent feel, with whatever syntax theme you like to use.

#### Installation
Inside atom go to settings, select Install and search for Nucleus.

Or install directly from the console:

`apm install nucleus-dark-ui`

#### Requirements
Every color used in the UI is taken directly from a (dark) syntax theme. In order for this to work, the syntax theme needs to have a `syntax-variables.less`. A light version of this theme is still being worked on.
